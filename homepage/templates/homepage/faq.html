					<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">What won't I learn from this?</a>
					<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
						<p>You will not learn how to write words and you won't learn grammar. Learning to write kanji is extremely time intensive and has very little payoff since most writing nowadays is done via keyboard (seriously think about how often you even have to handwrite english) so it's better to focus your time learning other areas of Japanese. </p>

				<div class="accordion-section">
					<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-4">What if I already know a ton of words and kanji?</a>
					<div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">
						<p>That's fine! You have complete control over what you learn and don't learn. You don't have to relearn things you already know. Just go through our quick setup and you'll be good to go.</p>

				<div class="accordion-section">
					<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-5">How long will this take?</a>
					<div id="accordion-5" class="accordion-section-content">
						<p>It's up to you! You can go at your own pace. If you're ambitious you can add 6 kanji a day and finish all 2136 in a little under a year. This would also imply that you learn about 6,500 words in that same time period (that's up to you as well). Learning all the Jouyou kanji in a year is pretty unheard of for other programs including college courses etc.</p>

					<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-6">What is SRS?</a>
					<div id="accordion-6" class="accordion-section-content">
						<p>SRS stands for Spaced Repetition System. Basically, after we learn things we tend to forget them over time, which is a big problem when learning something like Japanese. Too often people will learn a kanji reading or a word only to completely forget it a few days, weeks, or months later. SRS solves this problem by periodically showing you words that you have already studied and then based on whether you get it right or wrong, adjusting the amount of time that the word will be shown to you again in the future.</p>
